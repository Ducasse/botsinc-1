\part{Conditionals}
Up until now the execution of a  program was performed by executing \emph{all} the expressions it was composed of. There was no way to express that certain parts of a program have to be executed only when certain circumstances were met. In this part we present conditional expression, \ie, how to express that certain messages are only executed when certain conditions are met. 

This part also introduces the notion of references in a 2D space and some other robot behavio. Then it presents how we can use a robot to simulate the behavior of simple animals.
