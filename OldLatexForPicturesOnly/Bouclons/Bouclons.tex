We are sure that you have ideas of nice drawings, but you did not have the heart to draw scripts to draw them.  Indeed, the amount of things to type gets larger and larger as the complexity of the drawing augments. In this chapter, you will learn how to reduce the amount of expressions given to a robot using loops. Loops allow you to \emph{repeat a sequence of messages}. With a loop, the script for drawing an hexagon or an octagon is no bigger than the one drawing a square.\section{A Star as a Motivating Example}We would like that a robot draws a star as shown in the picture above. The principle is the following one: A robot has to draw a line, comes back to its previous location, turns from a certain angle and draws another line and so on. The \scriptref{scr:line} makes a robot drawing a line of 70 pixelsand coming back to its previous location. Note that in addition, after having drawn the line the robot points in the same direction where it was pointing before drawing the line.\begin{scriptwithtitle}{Drawing a line and coming back}\label{scr:line}| \caro |\caro := \Turtle new.\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\end{scriptwithtitle}Now to draw a star, we have to \emph{repeat} part of the \scriptref{scr:line} and make the robot turns from a given angle, for example 60degrees. The \scriptref{scr:star} shows how this should be done toobtain a star having 6 branches without using loops.\begin{scriptwithtitle}{A star without loop!}\label{scr:star}| \caro |\caro := \Turtle new.\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro turnLeft: 60. \textit{\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro turnLeft: 60.}\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\textit{\caro turnLeft: 60. \caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro turnLeft: 60.} \caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro turnLeft: 60. \textit{\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro go: 70.\caro turnLeft: 180.\caro turnLeft: 60.} \end{scriptwithtitle}As you see, this clearly does not scale to have to type all this code thatdoes all the time the same thing. Imagine if we would like to have astar with 60 branches like the star shown in the\scriptref{scr:starsixty}! In fact we would like to be able to repeat a sequence of messages.\paragraph{Using a  Loop.} There is a solution to this problem: use a \emph{loop!} There are different kinds of loops. For the moment the loop we present allows you to repeat a given sequence of messages a given number of times. The method \timesRepeat  \index{timesRepeat:} repeats a sequence of  messages a given number of times as shown in the \scriptref{scr:starloop}. The \scriptref{scr:starloop} defines the same star than the \scriptref{scr:star} but in a much shorter way. \begin{scriptwithtitle}{A star with a loop}\label{scr:starloop}| \caro |\caro := \Turtle new.6 timesRepeat: 
     \textbf{\textbf{[}\caro go: 70.     \caro turnLeft: 180.     \caro go: 70.     \caro turnLeft: 180.     \caro turnLeft: 60\textbf{]}}\end{scriptwithtitle} 

\cadre{\textit{n} \textbf{timesRepeat:}
   \textbf{[} \textit{sequence of messages} \textbf{]} repeats n times the sequence of messages.}The method \timesRepeat allows you to repeat a sequence of messages a given number of times. In \sq such a sequence of messages delimited by \ct{[} and \ct{]} is called a \emph{block}. Another interesting point is that \timesRepeat is not sent to a robot but to an integer, the number of times the sequence should be repeated. In the\scriptref{scr:starsixty} the message \timesRepeat \ct{[...]} is sentto \ct{60}. Finally note that the number receiving the message \timesRepeat has to be  a \emph{whole number}  because as in real life there is no sense to do a sequence of messages 0.2785 times.\cadre{The argument of \timesRepeat is a block, \ie a sequence of messages surrounded by \ct{[} and \ct{]}} 
Type the \scriptref{scr:starloop} and change the number oftimes the loop is repeated by replacing \ct{6} by the number you want.Pay attention that \ct{60} should be changed accordingly if you wantto generate a complete star. To have a complete star the relationbetween the angle and the number of repetition should be $angle * n =360$. In the \scriptref{scr:starsixty} the loop is repeated 60 times and the angle is 6 degrees, so the star is complete. \begin{exofig}{loopStar60}\label{scr:starsixty}
Write a script that draws A star with 60 branches.\hidden{| \caro |\caro := \Turtle new.60 timesRepeat: 
      \textbf{[}\caro  go: 70.      \caro  turnLeft: 180.      \caro go: 70.      \caro turnLeft: 180.      \caro turnLeft: 6\textbf{]}}\end{exofig}

\paragraph{About code indentation.}
In \st, the code can be laid out in all kind of ways and the indentation (its shape regardings the left margin) does not change a program. We say it does not affect the sense of the program. However, using a clear indentation really helps the reader to understand the code. We suggest to follow the convention we chose to format \ct{timesRepeat:} expressions. The idea is that the repeated block of expressions delimited by the characters \ct{[} and \ct{]} should form a visual and textual rectangle. That is why we start the block with \ct{[} on the next line after the \ct{timesRepeat:} and align all the expressions inside the block to one tab and finish by \ct{]} that indicates that the block ends. Note that code formatting is one of the most complex topics because different people like to read their code in different ways. So the one we propose is primarily focused at helping the identification of the repeated messages as illustrated in the following code

%\section{Typing in the Air}
%If you want to type directly the code of your loops using the balloon, you should realize that you need a way to tell that certain messages are sent to the robot itself, this is exactly the purpose of the word \ct{self} in \sq. 
%Figure~\ref{fig:fourtimesRepeat} shows how we can directly ask a \Turtle to draw a square with and without cascade. We will also see that \ct{self} is really necessary when we will define new kind of messages in Chapter~\ref{ch:abstraction}.

%\begin{figure}[!h]\centerline{\includegraphics{balloonSelf4timesRepeat}}\centerline{\includegraphics{balloonSelf4timesRepeatCascade}}
%\caption{Using \ct{self} to refer to the \Turtle that will receive the messages \ct{go: 100} and \ct{turnLeft: 90}. \label{fig:fourtimesRepeat}}\end{figure}


\section{Exercising Regular Shapes}As you may have noticed, some figures can be obtained by simplyrepeating sequences of messages, especially the ones produced inSection~\ref{sec:firstPolygons} of Chapter~\ref{ch:relativeTurn} (repeated here as the script~\ref{scr:boucl:relativeSquare}). %\begin{scriptfigwithsize}[0.4]{\includegraphics[width=4cm]{loopFirstSquare}}{A first square} \label{scr:boucl:relativeSquare}%| \caro |%\caro := \Turtle new.%\caro go: 100.%\caro turnLeft: 90.%\caro go: 100.%\caro turnLeft: 90.%\caro go: 100.%\caro turnLeft: 90.%\caro go: 100.%\caro turnLeft: 90%\end{scriptfigwithsize}

\begin{scriptwithtitle}{A first square} \label{scr:boucl:relativeSquare}| \caro |\caro := \Turtle new.\caro go: 100.\caro turnLeft: 90.\caro go: 100.\caro turnLeft: 90.\caro go: 100.\caro turnLeft: 90.\caro go: 100.\caro turnLeft: 90\end{scriptwithtitle}
\begin{exonofig}\label{exo:squareRepeat}Transform the \scriptref{scr:boucl:relativeSquare} todraw the same square but using the command \timesRepeat.\end{exonofig}Now you should be able to draw other regular polygons with a largenumber of sides.\begin{exofigwithsize}{\includegraphics[width=4cm]{loopPentagon}} \label{exo:pentagonRepeat}Draw a pentagon using the method \timesRepeat.\end{exofigwithsize}\begin{exofigwithsize}{\includegraphics[width=4cm]{loopHexagon}}\label{exo:hexagonRepeat}Draw a hexagon using the command \timesRepeat.\end{exofigwithsize}If you get the hang of it, try to augment the number of sides of apolygon to a very large number. You may need to reduce the size ofthe sides so that figure fits within the screen. When thenumber of sides is large and the size of the sides is small, thepolygon will look like a circle.\section{Pyramids Rediscovered}\label{sec:bouclonpyramids}Remember how you coded the outline of the pyramid of Saqqarah in\exoref{exo:saqqarah}? You can simplify your drawing by using a loop as follows:\begin{scriptfig}{loopPyramid}{Pyramid script} \label{scr:pyramid}| \caro |\caro := \Turtle new.5 timesRepeat: 
     [\caro north.     \caro go: 20.     \caro east.     \caro go: 20].5 timesRepeat: 
     [\caro go: 20.     \caro south.     \caro go: 20.     \caro east].\caro west.\caro go: 200.\end{scriptfig}Now you should be able to generate pyramids with any number ofterraces \emph{with the same number of expressions}, just by changingthe numbers of the script.\begin{exofig}{loopPyramid10} \label{exo:pyramid}Try to draw a pyramid with 10 terraces using a variation of Script~\ref{scr:pyramid}.\end{exofig}You may want to generate pyramids with an even larger number ofterraces. The size of the terraces must be adjusted if you wantthem to fit within the screen.\section{Some Selected Problems}As you have seen, the generation of the pyramid involves therepetition of a block of code, which draws two line elements. Once theproper repeating element is identified, one can produce complexpicture from elementary drawing, by repeating themselves.  Thefollowing exercises illustrate this principle.\begin{exofigwithsizeandtitle}{\includegraphics[width=4cm]{loopCross}}{Cross} \label{exo:redcross}Draw the outline of the cross shown on the right using \turnLeft or \turnRight and\timesRepeat.\end{exofigwithsizeandtitle}\begin{exofigwithtitle}{loopStair}{Stair}\label{exo:stair}Draw the following stair.\end{exofigwithtitle}


\hidden{| \caro |\caro := \Turtle new.10 timesRepeat: [ \caro go: 10.                \caro north.                \caro go: 10.                \caro east]}\begin{exofigwithtitle}{loopStylisedStair}{Stylized Stair}\label{exo:stylizedstair}Draw the following stylized stair.\end{exofigwithtitle}
\hidden{loopstylisedstair	| \caro |	\caro := \Turtle new.	10 timesRepeat: [                \caro go: 10.                \caro north.                \caro jump: 10.                \caro east]}\begin{exofigwithsizeandtitle}{\includegraphics{loopSimpleElement}}{A Simple Element}\label{exo:element}Draw the following graphical element.\end{exofigwithsizeandtitle}\hidden{| \caro |\caro := \Turtle new.\caro north. \caro go: 25.\caro west.\caro go: 25.\caro south.\caro go: 25}\begin{exofigwithsizeandtitle}[0.3]{\includegraphics{loopComb}}{Comb}\label{exo:comb}Transform the \scriptref{exo:element} to produce a comb.\end{exofigwithsizeandtitle}\hidden{| \caro |\caro := \Turtle new.8 timesRepeat: [\caro north. \caro go: 25.\caro west.\caro go: 25.\caro south.\caro go: 25]}\begin{exofigwithsizeandtitle}{\includegraphics{loopLadder}}{Ladder}\label{exo:ladder}Transform the \scriptref{exo:element} to produce a ladder.\end{exofigwithsizeandtitle}\hidden{| \caro |\caro := \Turtle new.8 timesRepeat: [\caro north. \caro go: 25.\caro west.\caro go: 25.\caro south.\caro go: 25.\caro north.\caro jump: 25.\caro east.\caro jump: 25]}\begin{exonofig}Now that you master loops define a loop that draws the tumbling squares of the picture shown at the opening of Chapter~\ref{ch:relativeTurn}.\end{exonofig}
