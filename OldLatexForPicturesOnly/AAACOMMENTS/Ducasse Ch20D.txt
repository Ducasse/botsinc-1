Chapter 20
==========

This chapter strikes me as oddly placed, as you've been talking about booleans and their use throughout the entire book. 

>> Where? I would be curious to know where. The only place where I talked about booleans was in the two previous conditional chapters. 


 At a minimum, the introduction is not giving the reader any indication of what further information they'll learn from this chapter.  If I believed from reading the first part of the manuscript that I knew booleans and their uses fairly well, and I read the introduction to this chapter, I would probably skip it.

>> I said that I will go into the details and explain how to express more complex expressions. 

If this is not what you want the reader to do, then I recommend you give the reader more of a "what more will I get out of this chapter" type of introduction.

180 your explanation of context has lost the reader.  Please refine and make clearer.

183 I am assuming that by "confirmed programmer" you mean "experienced programmer" or "professional programmer"

>> fixed

184 I don't recall being introduced to the term "unary expression" - the reader may feel lost and discount this entire paragraph.  Either introduce here or add a refresher sentence that jogs the reader's memory

>> chapter 12.
>> there is a reference to that chapter the line above.
