p58 Fig 6.2
It may not be clear to all readers why that thickening line (which looks more like a wedge!) does what it is doing? I wonder if more clarity would be good here?

>> I do not really know what I can do. 
I stressed the instructions in the code.


p58
"using the method color: (pica color..."
The brackets here are misleading to the reader as they look like syntax

>> fixed

p58
"h:s:v" and "r:g:b" aren't explained clearly enough for some of your reader base imo. Consider slowing this little bit down?

>> I removed hsv and explained.



p58
"For example the expression Color r: 1 g:0 b:0" 
also confuses the reader as you are sending mixed messages re: the syntax -- is there a space or not after the colon ??

>> fixed but this makes no dfference


p58
Script 6.4 - has the same problem as the above comment re: colon and spaces in the "r: 1 g:0 b:0" statement

p58 Script 6.4
"Produce a pure red"
"To choose your color directlty" [sic]

1) there is a typo on "directl
2) does your reader know what this means with text in quotes in the scripts like this? I think it will confuse them - is it part of the script or not??

>> fixed

p59
PLEASE NOTE YOU HAVE LEFT YOURSELF A FLAG HERE TO CHANGE IT LATER


p59 - through to the end of Ch6:
I will wait until you update this section as you say you are going to... my impression on this section is that it looks great fun :) but that it doesn't quite step the reader through each step of what to do closely and step-by-step enough? Please be careful of that? The pretty pictures are enticing but the steps of EXACTLY what to do to are less obvious and could lead to frustration quickly. 

>> I will.
