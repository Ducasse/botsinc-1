Chapter 24
==========

i'm really quite pleased with this chapter.  your judicious use of figures coupled with cogent explanations make it very easy for the reader to follow you.  i especially like the tips section that accompanies.

A few issues:


"morph" should be globally replaced with "drawing" or "sketch"

>> ok I did that

is there a summary for this chapter?

>> no
