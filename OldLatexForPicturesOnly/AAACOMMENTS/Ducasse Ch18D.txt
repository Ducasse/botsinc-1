Chapter 18
==========

161 Your intro to the chapter here is a little weak; you use the term condition in a sentence without really giving the reader a context for it.  Perhaps some rewording is in order.

162:  what is @@tron@@?  This may be ignorance on my part, but I'm not sure what this.

>> this is french
because I could not find the english

section 4 is very helpful.  I like the way you guide the reader through the debugging process and add the trace.  Examples like this throughout the text add great value for the reader.

You might consider expanding the summary section a bit, as it seems like we learned more in this chapter than you let on with the single bullet point.
