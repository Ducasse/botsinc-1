p75 "mandatory" - simpler word? "necessary" ?

>> fixed

    

p75 "correlated" - simpler word? that I can't think of a corresponding word here suggests the sentence itself needs rewriting Stephane - the concept and point of the sentence must be too opaque if I cannot quickly find a replacement word?

>> linked


p75
"dependencies between numbers" - this is a difficult concept also, and linked to the previous point I made. Please consider making this sequence simpler/more down to earth for some of your readers?

>> I did my best


p75
Note the reference to Chapter ?? etc.

>> fixed


p76
The "middle" thing isn't clear to me what you mean etc.

>> changed the pic and added an explanattion

p76
"By synchronously, we mean that 100 should become 200, 70 100 ...without mixing them."
I think it would be clearer if you arrowed to the places int he script where these numbers are, and say "replace this number" etc. It is a little abstract like this how it relate dto the script?

>> I do not see what I can really do. If people do it they will automatically ace the problem and I chose on purpose these values. 


p76 Experiment 8.3
Just brilliant.

p77 "errorprone" - why? you didn't nail that at all. "Tiresome"? what if the reader loved every minute?
I recommend instead of these negatives, to say more neutrally "you have to change the numbers each time, which sometimes can be very repetitive - especially when we have lots of repeated tasks to do " or something? Oh I don't know - perhaps your more emotional words are better :-)

>> yes. Because if you try to recreate all the letters then this is a real pain.


p77 "i.e." please remember to use "that is" instead

>> fixed


p77 "vertical bars"
worth mentioning where htey have seen these before re: robots etc. {Oh you do this a little later}

>> ;)
on purpose also because I could have develop an environment which does not require variable declarations.


p78
"using a variable" --> refering to a variable; you think that is made clear enough?

>> changed 

p78 "About Pica"
I think maybe spend longer on this robots/variables point. It's quite deep and the reader may need more time.

>> but there is nothing special here.
So it would make it longer and there is the following chapter for that purpose.


p79 Script 8.2
I'm not sure you really nail this one Stephane. The example feels a little weak/obscure and lacks a dynamic delivery to the reader. How could you make it more engaging -- it's SUCH an important moment in the reader's scripting, but NOTHING happens much when you introduce it - no reward, no visual, no explanation afterwards etc. Feels like an anti-climax and thus a shadow-moment for your reader.


>>  I added another script, used emphasis in the text, added a new visual, and  finally I added a paragraph at the end.



p79 
"To be read efficiently or simply nice to look at, a letter should respect certain proportions, i.e., the
lengths that describe it are not freely chosen but maintain certain proportions between them. Let us
decide that the width should be 2/3 of the height and that the middle should be at 3/5 of the height."
--->
This is too obscure! at least a visual nearby to show what you are talking about? Especially given the wonderful importance of Script 8.3 in the reader's learning??

>> I revised it

p80
tough math !

>>really one addition and one division
