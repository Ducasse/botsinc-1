p86 diagram
Make sure the diagram (a)-(d) clearly visually relate to the four lines of code at the top!

p87
Please remember to use "I" not "we"?

p88
too many scripts not enough visual break-outs?

I think the chapter would just succeed more for the reader if that final sequence of scripts had some nice visuals here and there to break it up a little and reassure the reader they are understanding, visually?


>> every script is commented step by step. 
And I added some visuals.
