Up until now the programs we defined \replace{were executing}{executed} \textit{all} the \replace{messages that composed them}{expressions they contained,} one after the other.

@@dank: I suggest rearranging the material to introduce ifTrue: first.  It is simpler and easier to explain than ifFalse: and ifTrue:ifFalse:.  Then you could cover ifFalse: and finally ifTrue:ifFalse:.  I think that most students would learn with less effort that way. Then the above script would be:

\replace{Let us}{Let's} analyze \remove{now} what happens when the expression \ct{\caro distanceDetector} is executed. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The expression \ct{self distanceFrom: World center} computes the distance from the receiver to the center of the screen. This distance is stored into the variable \ct{dist}. 

\item Then the expression \ct{dist < 200 ifTrue: [self color: Color red] ifFalse: [self color: Color green]} is executed as follows: \textit{if} the distance is smaller than 200\add{,} the color of the receiver is changed to red\replace{ else}{; otherwise} it is changed to green. This expression is a \textit{conditional} expression. \add{(It is spread over three lines in the method definition but it is all one expression, because there is no period to terminate it earlier.)}
 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{A conditional expression \add{is} composed of a condition and conditional messages.
@@dank: Would it be more consistent with previous usage to call them 'conditional blocks' instead of messages?  This would also avoid ambiguous meanings of the plural: sometimes 'conditional messages' might refer to both the true & false branches, other times to multiple messages in one branch. 'Block' would make it easier to distinguish. This change should then propagate throughout the chapter, though I have marked it only in a few places; if you accept the change, I will revise accordingly.@@\label{fig:distanceDetector}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A conditional expression is composed of two parts: a \index{condition}\textit{condition} and \index{conditional messages} \textit{conditional messages}. 
The expression \ct{dist < 200} is a condition and the expressions \ct{[self color: Color red]} and \ct{[self color: Color green]} are conditional messages\add{,}  as shown by Figure~\ref{fig:distanceDetector}.   

The method \ct{ifTrue:ifFalse:} executes one condition, here \ct{dist < 200}, and depending of its value, executes \add{one of} the \add{conditional} messages \replace{corresponding to the true or the false case}{and skips the other}. The keyword \ct{ifTrue:} indicates that the conditional message \ct{[self color: Color red]} is only executed when the condition \add{\ct{dist < 200}} is true. Similarly the keyword \ct{ifFalse:} indicates that  the conditional message  \ct{[self color: Color green]} is only executed when the condition is false.

\replace{What you see is that}{So} there are different kinds of expressions. Some such as \ct{self distanceFrom: World center} are always executed\add{,} while others are executed only when their \replace{associate}{associated} condition \replace{hold.}{holds. \paragraph
}
\replace{Note that a}{Each} conditional \replace{expression}{message is a block enclosed in square brackets \ct{[ ]}. A block} is not limited to \replace{one}{a} single \replace{message}{expression,} but can \replace{be}{contain} a \replace{composition of messages as presented in Chapter~\ref{cha:boolean}}{series of statements as you saw in Chapter~\ref{cha:variables}}. The method \ct{ifTrue:ifFalse:} defines two possible executions\add{,} which can \add{each} contain \replace{complex}{a} sequence of messages.  \add{\paragraph
}
Note that the method \ct{ifTrue:ifFalse:} is a \textit{single} method with two arguments, one for the true case and one for the false case. \replace{Therefore you should not}{If you} put a period \replace{after the \ct{]} following the \ct{ifTrue:}}{before the \ct{ifFalse:} part, it will break the conditional statement by ending it too soon, causing an error}.


When we presented how to define methods in Chapter~\ref{ch:turtleTeaching} we explained that executing a method not only evaluates the messages it contains\add{,} but also returns a value. 
Up until now we \replace{did}{have} not really used the result returned by \replace{methods}{a method}. \replace{Now for the condition expression 
we are essentially interested by}{But for some conditional expressions,} the result returned by \replace{the}{a} method\add{ is essential}. For example in method \ref{mth:detector}, the expression  \ct{self distanceFrom: World center} not only computes the distance of the receiver from the center of the screen but \add{also} \textit{returns} \replace{it}{that distance}.  The condition expression, \ct{dist < 200}, uses this value to decide \replace{wich}{which} branch \replace{should be executed}{to execute}. 

@@dank: Is ifFalse:ifTrue: important? Since this is an introductory textbook, not a reference, I recommend omitting it entirely (along with the related figure and following paragraphs) as a rarely-used feature. It offers little to a beginner but an opportunity for confusion. @@
\paragraph{\ct{ifTrue:ifFalse} and \ct{ifFalse:ifTrue:}.}
The method \ct{ifFalse:ifTrue:} also exists. It works the same way the method \ct{ifTrue:ifFalse:}, \ie it executes the false case when the condition is false and the true one when the condition is true, exactly as the method \ct{ifTrue:ifFalse:}. This method is just \remove{there} to help you \replace{writing}{write} more readable code if you want to start \replace{reading}{with} the messages executed when the condition is false as shown by Figure~\ref{fig:conditionalifTifFifFifT}.

\fprod{production the following should be in a frame}
A conditional expression is composed of two parts: a \index{condition}\textit{condition} and \index{conditional messages} \textit{conditional messages}.

\section{Two Other Conditional Messages: \ct{ifTrue:} and \ct{ifFalse:}}

Sometimes we only need to perform \replace{one}{an} action when a \replace{given}{specific} condition is true\add{,} but \add{do} nothing when the condition is false \add{(} or vice versa\add{)}. For example the method \ct{redWhenCloseToCenter} (\ref{mth:redWhenCloseToCenter}) only changes the color of the receiver to red when it is at a distance smaller than 200 pixels from the screen center.

\begin{method}\label{mth:redWhenCloseToCenter}
redWhenCloseToCenter
   | dist | 
   dist := self distanceFrom: World center.
   dist < 200
      \bold{ifTrue: [}self color: Color red \bold{]}
      \bold{ifFalse: []}
\end{method}

Using the method \ct{ifTrue:ifFalse:} we just have to leave the second branch empty \ie\ \ct{[]}. However, \st provides two other methods \remove{\ct{ifTrue:} and \ct{ifFalse:}} to express \replace{this kind}{these kinds} of conditional expressions\add{: \ct{ifTrue:} and \ct{ifFalse:}}. The method \ct{ifTrue:} executes its conditional messages when its condition is true. Using the method \ct{ifTrue:} we rewrite the method \ct{redWhenCloseToCenter} shown in \ref{mth:redWhenCloseToCenter} as shown in \mthref{mth:redWhenCloseToCenter2}.

\begin{method}\label{mth:redWhenCloseToCenter2}
redWhenCloseToCenter
   | dist | 
   dist := self distanceFrom: World  center.
   dist < 200
      \bold{ifTrue:} [self color: Color red]
\end{method}

Contrary to \ct{ifTrue:}, the method \ct{ifFalse:} executes its conditional messages when its condition is \emph{false}. The methods \replace{\ct{ifFalse:}}{\ct{ifTrue:}} and \ct{ifFalse:} both execute a condition and\add{,} depending on the value returned by the condition, \add{either} execute or \replace{not}{skip} the conditional messages. \add{\paragraph
}
@@dank: Are the next paragraph and related figure important? I recommend omitting them, and treating this topic along with boolean expressions.@@
Note that we can always negate \add{(logically reverse)} a condition to \replace{pass}{switch} from one form to the other. \replace{As shown}{For example} in method~\ref{mth:redWhenCloseToCenter3}, \ct{dist >= 200} is the negation of the expression \ct{dist < 200}. 

\begin{method}\label{mth:redWhenCloseToCenter3}
redWhenCloseToCenter
   | dist | 
   dist := self distanceFrom: World  center.
   \bold{dist >= 200}
      \bold{ifFalse:} [self color: Color red]
\end{method}


\fprod{production the following should be in a frame}
The method \ct{ifTrue:} executes its conditional messages when its condition is true.
The method \ct{ifFalse:} executes its conditional messages when its condition is false.

\begin{nalltt}
\textit{aCondition}
      \textbf{ifTrue: [} \textit{messagesIfConditionIsTrue} \textbf{]}

\textit{aCondition}
      \textbf{ifFalse: [} \textit{messagesIfConditionIsFalse} \textbf{]}
\end{nalltt}
\fprod{until here}

@@dank: I recommend cutting the next paragraph from the book, as it is not essential to beginners.  It is a special type of logic error that doesn't seem more important than other logic errors that haven't been singled out for similar treatment.  If it is included, the explanation should be expanded with two pairs of illustrative examples: one pair where ifTrue:ifFalse is logically equivalent to ifTrue: and ifFalse:, and another pair where it is logically different.  If you decide to keep this topic, I could draft an extended explanation and examples for your review and revision. @@
\paragraph{A Subtle Point.}  The difference between using \ct{ifTrue:ifFalse:}\add{,} and \ct{ifTrue:} followed by \ct{ifFalse:} \add{using the same condition,} is that the \textit{condition} using \ct{ifTrue:ifFalse:} is only executed once, while with \ct{ifTrue:} followed by \ct{ifFalse:} the conditions of the two conditional expressions are executed twice. This can be a problem when \add{the} conditional messages of the first conditional expression (\ct{ifTrue:}) \replace{modifies}{modify} what is tested by the condition of the second conditional expression (\ct{ifFalse:}). In such a case using \ct{ifTrue:} followed by \ct{ifFalse:} is not equivalent to using \ct{ifTrue:ifFalse:}.



\section{Nesting Conditional Expressions}
A conditional expression can contain any other messages and in particular other conditional expressions. This is what we \replace{present now}{demonstrate next}. There is nothing spectacular \add{about it,} but it is common \add{--- and} that is 
why we want to show it to you. Conditions can be nested inside conditions.

\paragraph{Another Simple Problem.}
\replace{Let us}{Let's} modify \replace{our}{the} previous problem. Now \remove{we would like that} if a robot is \replace{located at a distance smaller}{less} than 200 pixels from \replace{a point}{the center,} it should be red\replace{,}{;} when it is between 200 and 300 pixels \add{away,} it should be yellow\add{;} and at a distance greater than 300\add{,} it should be green.

     "change the color of the robot so that it is blue aiming 
     at the north and red to the south"
     self turn: anAngle.
     self direction = 90
         ifTrue: [self color: Color blue].
     self direction = -90
         ifTrue: [self color: Color red]
         ifFalse: [self color: Color green]
\end{method}

\add{The above definition is not correct. Try to understand why before reading any farther. }

\replace{This}{The above} method is wrong because when the robot is pointing to the north\add{,}  its color is green\replace{ while}{. But} it should be blue\add{,} as shown in \tscrref{scr:illustbug} and \tscrref{scr:bug}.
