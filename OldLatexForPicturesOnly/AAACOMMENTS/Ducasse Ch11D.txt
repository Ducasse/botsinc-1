Nice chapter, I feel the learning curve is a little bit too steep right now though? perhaps you could help the reader a tiny bit more? I know you are trying to stretch them here, but ...

>> I will try but again my reader is not a 10 year old kid. 


p98 "grows 10 by 10 pixels " <--- you mean just by 10 pixels right?

>> fixed


p98
"Here, 20 = 10 + 10, 30 = 20 + 10, 40 = 30 + 10,.... If we use the variable length to
represent the length of a step, we see that the length of the second step is the length of the first step
plus 10, that the length of the third step is the length of the second step plus 10... We"
---> recommend the use of a visual here for your reader
---> otherwise it's all a bit abstract!

>> we should not exaggerate. 
Knowing how to express it is not trivial but the fact that a step is 10 pixels
than the previous one is trivial.


p100
"as well as the spiral shown in figure 11.2" <--- 11.3 ?
(hey that's quite tough hehe)

>> no this is right


p101
You think maybe explain how to do 11.2 explicitly? the step of logic required is quite tough in this beautiful looking chapter

>> no this is easy and if I say how to do it this is totally stupid. 


Ditto for some of the others - motivating yes, easy? not for some of your readers!!
>> I added some hints

Oh - no summary?
 :)

I added another section and a small summary.
