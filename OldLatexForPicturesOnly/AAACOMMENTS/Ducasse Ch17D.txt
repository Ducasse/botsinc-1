Chapter 17
==========
This is a good chapter; I think it has a nice flow and is very helpful to the reader.  Steps gradually into transcripts, traces, etc.

A few edits here:

149 - perhaps callout box is redundant?

152 - "A string doesnot know out to perform any math..."  perhaps change this to something like "Squeak cannot perform mathematical operations with strings"

>> no OOP thinking this is the right way to express sentence. 


152 bottom - have you defined "flaps" earlier in the text?
>> Yes

fig 17.1 and 17.2 have identical captions
