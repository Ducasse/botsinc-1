Chapter 16
==========

I like this chapter but you may be asking just a bit too much of the reader to make jumps of logic so great as in your first examples in the chapter.  The educational principle of breaking down a problem, solving the smaller problems, and assembling those mini-solutions into a larger solution is definitely sound, but I would advise providing more guidance to the reader initially when he's looking back at earlier work and re-tooling it using new material he's learned.

>> I did my best there. 

We/our - I/my issue is present.  Consider changing to more direct voice.

>>ok fixed.

Other than that, no major qualms.
